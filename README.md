A native text editor built using Electron!

This is a simple demo project that I started to learn how to create a simple native app with as little dependencies as possible using the [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) framework!

The project also includes the [Electron Builder](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder) framework to create compiled executables for production releases.

## How to Use
The compiled version of the project can be run from the latest compiled executable in the repository [releases](https://github.com/Offroaders123/Electron-Text-Editor/releases/latest) section.

If you would like to see the source code or try the compiling process yourself, feel free to clone the repository and check it out!
