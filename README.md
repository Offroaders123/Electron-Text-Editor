A native text editor built using Electron!

This is a simple demo project that I started to learn how to create a simple native app with as little dependencies as possible using the [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) framework!

The project also includes the [Electron Builder](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder) framework to create compiled executables for production releases.

## How to Use
The latest compiled example of the project is available to download for either Windows or macOS from the [latest releases page](https://github.com/Offroaders123/Electron-Text-Editor/releases/latest).

If you would like to see the source code or try the compiling process yourself, feel free to clone the repository and see how it works! I made this to help myself understand how to use Electron, and I hope it will help you do the same!
