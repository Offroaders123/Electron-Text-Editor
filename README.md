A native text editor built using Electron!

This is a simple demo project that I started to learn how to create a simple native app with as little dependencies as possible using the (Electron)[https://www.electronjs.org/] framework.
The project also includes the (Electron Builder)[https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder] framework to create compiled executables for production releases.

## How to Use
The compiled version of the project can be run from the lastest compiled executable in GitHub Relases.
If you would like to see the source code itself or try the compiling process, feel free to clone the repo and check it out!
